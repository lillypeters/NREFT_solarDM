Conversion factors between the capture rate of dark matter in the Sun and the coupling constants squared of generalized dark matter-nucleon interactions in a non-relativistic effective field theory framework (see e.g. arXiv:1203.3542), including velocity and momentum dependent interactions.

The Conversion factors are provided for spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1 dark matter particles for dark matter masses 5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 100, 250, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 3000, 5000, 8000 and 10000 GeV. They are given in GeV^4/s. For details see arXiv:2108.05203.
